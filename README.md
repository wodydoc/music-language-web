# Project Name: CANTAR

## Description

A service that allows users to study a foreign language through music by providing the ability to -
    search the lyrics of a song, 
    translate a word or group of words, 
    view the entire translation in parallel text,
    generate a flashcard from the selected word,
    generate a fill in the blank quiz from selected lines of text,
    save and organize new vocabulary words by tagging them with a keyword,
    and track their learning progress.
